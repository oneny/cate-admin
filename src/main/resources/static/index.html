Spring Boot supports both static and templated welcome pages.
It first looks for an index.html file in the configured static content locations.
If one is not found, it then looks for an index template.
If either is found, it is automatically used as the welcome page of the application.
<a href="/hello">hello</a>
</body>
</html>
